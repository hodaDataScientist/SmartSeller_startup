# SmartSeller_startup
This repository contains all the documents and notebooks created for the Diginext startup bootcamp. The mission of the Smart Seller startup was to develop a recommendation system for Digikala sellers, enabling more efficient product selection and listing to enhance seller satisfaction. This startup was modeled after the Helium10 Blackbox tool.
